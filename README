# Kura Labs Repo

This is where I will keep my programs, scripts and projects I've created during the Kura Labs Bootcamp

## Cheapdate.py
This script was from an assignement where we created our first python program. We were tasked with having a couple go on a date, order food and decide if there would be a second date.

I used lists, dictionaries, functions and inputs. It's been years since I've written python, so this wasn't a bad first attempt.
